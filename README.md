# Clim-HydroDB-2.0
Material related to converting the original climHydroDB into CUAHSI ODM.

### The next working group meeting will be held on November 14, 2019 3 PM ET.

# Major activities (also see issues)
- Strategic workshop on “Next generation climate/hydrological data products” (organized by EDI, LTER, Forest Service) for developing a strategy on harmonizing weather, climate and hydrological data in the EDI data repository and ClimDB/HydroDB  (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, March 2019).
  - The results of the workshop were presented at an LTER Information Manager Water Cooler (April 9, 2019).
  - Reported activities to LTER Science Council in May 2019.
- Explore the ODM data model and CUAHSI functionality regarding its suitability for LTER and EDI meteorological and hydrological data products.

- Establish workflow and best practices documentation in EDI's gitHub space for:
  - Available tools for converting data from raw (L0) to ODM (L1) data model.
  - Develop examples of how to access/extract data in CUAHSI via R or API interface, for one parameter across all LTER sites (maintaining ClimDB/HydroDB functionality).
  - Vocabulary: mapping between LTER and EML site parameter names and ODM controlled vocabulary.

- Brainstorming about possible L2 products (data products for education and outreach, NCO synthesis working groups, time averages and spatial aggregates, input for great "L50" products like waterviz.org, or smartforests.org.

- Report activities to LTER Science Council in May 2019

- Discuss at 2019 IMC meeting in Tacoma
  - Determine timeline of ClimDB/HydroDB retirement and archiving in EDI.
  - Set deadline for LTER sites' updates to ClimDB/HydroDB.

- Online hackathon with LTER Information Managers to fill out ODM tables
