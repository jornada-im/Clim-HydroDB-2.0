# Major activities (also see issues)

## Past activities
- Strategic workshop in March 2019 on “Next generation climate/hydrological data products” (organized by EDI, LTER, Forest Service) for developing a strategy on harmonizing weather, climate and hydrological data in the EDI data repository and ClimDB/HydroDB  (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM).
  - Workshop results were presented at LTER Information Manager Water Cooler on April 9, 2019.
  - Reported activities to LTER Science Council in May 2019.
- Explore the ODM data model and CUAHSI functionality regarding its suitability for LTER and EDI meteorological and hydrological data products.
  - Contacted CUAHSI regarding services & recommendations for our data products (April 2019).
  - EDI webinar (June 18, 2019) “CUAHSI Tools for Data Management”: Introducing example data in CUAHSI and the functionality of the CUAHSI workspace (speaker: Martin Seul, Technical Director of CUAHSI).
  - Working Session at ESIP Summer Meeting (Tacoma, WA, July 2019): “Preparing climate and hydrological time series data for submission to CUAHSI”. Moderator: Corinna Gries (EDI); Speakers: M. Seul (CUAHSI), W. Sheldon (LTER), M. O’Brien (EDI), S. Remillard (LTER).

## Ongoing and upcoming activities
- Provide examples of converting site L0 raw and ClimDB/HydroDB data to CUAHSI/ODM standard (L1)
  - Develop workflow and best practices for data conversion from L0 to L1 using the GCE toolbox and R/Python.

- Establish workflow and best practices documentation in EDI's gitHub space for:
  - Available tools for converting data from raw (L0) to ODM (L1) data model.
  - Explore automated workflow available in PASTA
  - Develop examples of how to access/extract data in CUAHSI via R or API interface, for one parameter across all LTER sites (maintaining ClimDB/HydroDB functionality).
  - Vocabulary: mapping between LTER and EML site parameter names and ODM controlled vocabulary.

- Brainstorming about possible L2 products (data products for education and outreach, NCO synthesis working groups, time averages and spatial aggregates, input for great "L50" products like waterviz.org, or smartforests.org.

- Discuss at upcoming LTER IM Exec meeting possibility to:
  - Determine timeline of ClimDB/HydroDB retirement and archiving in EDI.
  - Set deadline for LTER sites' updates met and hydro data to ClimDB/HydroDB.
  - Provide metadata for site informationin CUAHSI site worksheet.

- Online hackathon with LTER Information Managers to fill out ODM tables.
