# Clim-HydroDB-2.0
Material related to converting the original climHydroDB into CUAHSI ODM.

# major activities (also see issues)
- Explore the ODM data model and CUAHSI functionality regarding its suitability for LTER and EDI meteorological and hydrological data products.
  - Contact CUAHSI regarding services & recommendations for our data products.
  - Plan webinar for introducing example data in CUAHSI and the functionality of the CUAHSI workspace.
  - Organize ESIP workshop with members of CUAHSI and Information Managers.
  - Provide examples of converting site L0 raw and ClimDB/HydroDB data to CUAHSI/ODM standard (L1)
  - Develop workflow and best practices for data conversion from L0 to L1 using the GCE toolbox and R/Python.

- Establish workflow and best practices documentation in EDI's gitHub space for:
  - Available tools for converting data from raw (L0) to ODM (L1) data model.
  - Develop examples of how to access/extract data in CUAHSI via R or API interface, for one parameter across all LTER sites (maintaining ClimDB/HydroDB functionality).
  - Vocabulary: mapping between LTER and EML site parameter names and ODM controlled vocabulary.

- Brainstorming about possible L2 products (data products for education and outreach, NCO synthesis working groups, time averages and spatial aggregates, input for great "L50" products like waterviz.org, or smartforests.org.

- Report activities to LTER Science Council in May 2019

- Discuss at 2019 IMC meeting in Tacoma
  - Determine timeline of ClimDB/HydroDB retirement and archiving in EDI.
  - Set deadline for LTER sites' updates to ClimDB/HydroDB.

- Online hackathon with LTER Information Managers to fill out ODM tables
