# Readme

Directory holds scripts and control files for downloading content from ClimDB in the ODM format.

## ODM has 6 required tables:
- Variables: 
- Sites 	
- Sources
- Methods
- QualityControl
- DataValues

Tables are arranged as a star schema, with DataValues table at the center, and FKs to the other 5 tables.

These bash scripts use the command line MS-SQL client to pull data from Climdb and arrange it for ODM. 
Input for all scripts is a list of sites (organizations) for which a table will be created.

To run these, you will need to:
1. clone this repository
1. install mssql (and whatever else you need for running bash shell - not covered here)
2. set the path variables in each script for your own directory structure
3. request the climdb password.
